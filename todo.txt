POTENTIAL TODOS
------------------
[ ] - Add character count to text fields. 400 chars?
    [ ] - Add it to edit field as well.
[ ] - Change Nav to be buttons instead of links potentially? Or another material ui thing?
[ ] - Refactor fixture players reducer, saga, and get route. Put players/fixture/:id in players.router.js.
